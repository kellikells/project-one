# project-one, Iphy Weather App

Project members: Dominica, Kelli, Meg, Stephanie

The purpose of our app is to allow the average person to search for the current weather by zipcode or city/state location

The result from user input is current hi/low temperature & a related giphy image, in addition to a forecast weather with appropriate weather icons provided by weatherbit

For our overall web page layout we used the Grid system and Bootstrap. We also developed our site mobile first. 
For the moving letters in our logo anime.js library is used. 

APIs for our backend:
  Weatherbit holds the Zip Code info & City name and State.
  GIPHY generates the image for Todayâ€™s Date
The four day forecast icons, minimum and high temperatures are generated from Weatherbit.
